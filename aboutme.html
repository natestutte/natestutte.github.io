                Hi!<br><br>

                My name is Nathan Stutte, but feel free to call me Nate. I'm currently finishing up my 
                time at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA working towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science.<br><br>

                I am very interested and passionate about the technological world, with keen interests in 
                Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science. In my working experience with 
                companies such as Vanguard Group, Nuix, and Drexel University I gained hands-on experience and 
                was able to challenge myself to develop and maintain production programs and software solutions. 
                These experiences not only enhanced my technical skills but also instilled in me passion for technology 
                that keeps me wanting to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.<br><br>

                Interested in learning more about me? Or maybe just want to chat? 
                Feel free to check my <a href=".\res\resume(12-4-23).pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> or contact me 
                at natestutte@protonmail.com or other social media platforms I'm on. I'm always open and happy to chat!
